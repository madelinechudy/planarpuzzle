# Getting Started with Planar Puzzle App

In order to select a square, click on it. The selected square will turn light grey. Once a square is selected, the arrows on the right will become enabled based on the moves available to the user. Click the arrow corresponding with the direction you decide to move and the respective square will be colored with the selected square's color. Then, select a new square to extend another color. You cannot extend from unused squares (black squares), so the arrows will be disabled when these squares are selected. You have to select a base square to extend from first. Click the reset button to clear the board, and the "Configuration 2" and "Configuration 3" buttons to switch to harder boards. A message revealing "You've Won!" will appear when you have solved the board. Good luck!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
